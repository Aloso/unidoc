Welcome to the unidoc playground! Unidoc is a simple markup language; It uses special characters to format text. You should see a unidoc document on the left (which you can edit) and the formatted result on the right.

## Headings

Headings are prefixed with 1 to 6 number signs, followed by a space:

  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  ### Heading 3
  #### Heading 4
  ##### Heading 5
  ###### Heading 6

Alternatively, headings can be underlined with equals signs or dashes:

  Heading 1
  =========

  Heading 2
  ---------

Pretty easy, right?

## Paragraphs

This is a paragraph of text. Multiple paragraphs are separated with a blank line.
Simple line breaks are ignored.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can contain multiple paragraphs.
>
> The `>` marker between paragraphs is optional.

> Blockquotes can also contain other blocks, such as headings, lists, or blockquotes:
> > A nested blockquote

## Lists

Lists are either ordered or unordered:

1. An ordered list
2. With two items

5) Another ordered list
6) Using closing parentheses

- An unordered list
- Containing a nested list:
  * This is a nested list
  * It doesn't matter what kind of bullet
    (`-`, `*`, `+`) you use, just don't mix
    different bullets in the same list

Note that a list marker must always be followed by a space, and subsequent lines must be properly indented.

## Inline formatting

Paragraphs can contain *italic* and **bold** text (with underscores: _italic_, __bold__). They can also contain ~strikethrough~, ^superscript^ and #subscript#.

Inline code is enclosed in backticks: `example` (or `` example ``). Inline code ignores formatting, i.e. `This is **not** bold`.

## Links and images

[This is a link](https://www.google.com).

![An image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloso/unidoc/main/doc/unidoc.svg)

Links have a link text in square brackets followed by a URL in parentheses. They can also contain a title in double quotes:

[This is a link](https://www.google.com "This text appears if you hover over me!").

Images have an alternative text (which appears when the image fails to load) and a URL. Like links, images can have a title in double quotes.

## Comments

// Comments start with two slashes. They are NOT displayed,
// so they're perfect for editorial notes.

## Thematic breaks

Thematic breaks are rendered as a horizontal line:

------------------

Thematic breaks can consist of dashes or stars, and must be at least 3 characters long.

## Code blocks

Code blocks start and end with a _code fence_. A code fence is a line containing at least 3 backticks or tildes:

```
This is a code block
```

The closing fence must contain at least as many backticks or tildes as the opening fence:

``````
```
```
``````

As in inline code, no formatting is performed in code blocks, so they're ideal for program code:

```rust
/// Does something interesting
fn foo(arr: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
    arr.iter()
        .filter(|n| *n < 2*3)
        .copied()
        .collect()
}
```

You can write the programming language after the opening code fence to get syntax highlighting (not implemented yet).

## Tables

#|| This is               | a header row
|| Each row starts        | with two vertical bars.
|| Cells are separated    | with a single vertical bar.
||# A header cell         |^ A center-aligned cell
||> A right-aligned cell  |<^{2;2} vertically centered 2-column cell
||{B;U} A bold, underlined cell
||^{1;2;color:red} An centered, red 2-row cell

Each cell can start with a _formatting modifier_, which consists of the following, optional parts:

* `#` for header cells
* `<`, `^` or `>` for horizontal alignment
* an additional `<`, `^` or `>` for vertical alignment
* `{}` containing:
  - the number of columns this cell spans
  - the number of rows this cell spans
  - `B`, `I`, `U` and/or `S` to make the cell bold, italic, underlined and strikethrough, respectively
  - arbitrary CSS rules

## HTML

HTML can be used anywhere: <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> <span class="hello">world</span>.

<style>
  .hello {
    color: orange;
  }
</style>

## Macros

There are macros for a variety of uses. Macros always start with a `@`, optionally followed by an all-uppercase word, optionally followed by arguments in parentheses:

```unidoc
@THIS(is a macro)
@(this is also){a macro}
@{as is this}
```

A macro always attaches to a block or an inline element

```unidoc
@BLOCK_MACRO
# Heading

@INLINE_MACRO`Code`
```

You can find a list of available macros further down.

## Escapes

Special characters can be escaped with the backslash `\`:

  \### This is not a heading

  \> This is not a quote
  and \**this is not bold**.

  \|| This is not a table

  \@{This is not a macro}

When you want to type backticks within inline code, you can use multiple backticks for the inline code:

  ```Look, `` two backticks!```

To create inline code that contains nothing but backticks, add spaces around the backticks:

  ` ``` `

To escape an image, if you add a backslash before the `!`, it will be treated as a link:

  \![Alternative text](url)

Instead add the backslash before the brackets:

  !\[Alternative text](url)

Numbers can't be escaped. Therefore, to escape an ordered list, put the backslashs before the dots or parentheses:

  1\. Not a list
  2\. Not a list

## Limiter

The limiter, `$` isn't rendered, ever. It's just and indication that parsing should be interrupted.

For example,~ this ~ isn't formatted as strikethrough because the word is surrounded by whitespace. This can be fixed by adding limiters:~$ text $~.

> The limiter can also be used
$
> to split a blockquote up.

1. And it can be used
2. To split a list
$
1. Into several lists

A limiter can also be added in a blank line
$
to connect multiple paragraphs.

<div style="font-size: 85%">$
    HTML elements are considered _inline_ only if there's
    text after the opening tag in the same line.

    Add a limiter after the tag to make the element inline.
</div>

## Substitutions

Some characters are automatically substituted. For example, 'single' and "double quotes", apostrophes, the ellipsis ..., (R), (C) and (TM). More substitutions can be added via plugins.

This is not yet implemented.

## List of available macros

### `@PASS`

With `@PASS`, formatted text is parsed even in inline code and in code blocks:

``````unidoc
@PASS
```
This is **bold**
```
``````

@PASS`This is **bold**`.

You can specify which kinds of syntax is parsed in the block. For example, `@PASS(macros,inline)` or `@PASS(@,i)` only parses macros and inline formatting. The full list is

* `inline`, `i` for inline formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough, etc.)
* `codeblock`, `c` for code blocks
* `heading`, `h` for headings
* `tbreak`, `b` for thematic breaks
* `subst`, `s` for text substitutions such as `->` to â†’
* `list`, `l` for lists
* `limiter`, `$` for the limiter
* `macro`, `@` for macros
* `math`, `%` for math blocks
* `table`, `|` for tables
* `quote`, `>` for blockquotes
* `html`, `<` for HTML elements

### `@NOPASS`

`@NOPASS` disables all formatting in the block, so it behaves like inline code and code blocks.

### `@()`

The macro with no name is used to add HTML attributes to elements. For example, the following adds a CSS class and an id to a code block:

  @(.cls #id)`Some code`

This adds a title attribute:

  @(title="hello world")`Some code`

It can also be applied to HTML:

  @(title="hello world")<span>Hover me</span>

The above is equivalent to using braces:

  @(title="hello world"){Hover me}
